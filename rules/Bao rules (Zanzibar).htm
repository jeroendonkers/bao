<P>Frequently in Bao several rules are applied at the same time. In those 
situations, it is important to apply the rules in the correct order. The 
hierarchy of the rules is of extreme importance. In this leaflet I will present 
the rules in as logical an order as possible. After reading and playing the 
rules you can use the scheme presented below to clarify the order of application 
of the rules when various rules come into conflict.</P>
<H2><A name=Variations>Variations in Rules</A></H2>
<P>The rules presented here were collected by Alex de Voogt between 1991 and 
1995. He was helped by Bao masters from Zanzibar. It is very possible that you 
will encouter different or additional rules to the ones presented here. These 
variants can be a lot of fun to play, but they are not the rules used during 
championship tournaments. In this article, I will only present the official 
rules as Alex de Voogt describes them.</P>
<H2><A name=Beginning>The Beginning</A></H2>
<P>Diagram 1 presents a view of a Bao board as seen from above. The rectangular 
holes called nyumba are clearly shown. The top two rows belong to your 
adversary; the bottom two are yours in this article.</P>
<P><B>diagram 1</B>: the Bao board seen from above (note that this image has not 
yet been reproduced. Instead, we present a textual version using the numeral 1

<P>In diagram 2 you see the same board, with the holes replaced by numbers. A 
'zero' means that there are no seeds in the hole, any other number represents 
that number of seeds in that hole.</P>

<P>As you see, each player has ten seeds at the start. The seeds are called 
<I>kete</I> (plural: kete). The other 22 seeds are kept off the board and are 
brought into play one by one. The process of introducing the additional kete 
divides a Bao game into two stages. During the first stage each player brings 
one seed into play each turn. This is called the <I>Namua</I> stage. If you win 
during the namua, you win <I>mkononi</I> ('in hand') because there are still 
seeds left in hand to bring into play.</P>
<P>If there is no winner during the first stage, players keep on playing with 
the seeds on the board until there is a winner. This is called the <I>Mtaji</I> 
stage. There are no draws in Bao. Theoretically, draws are possible, however, 
when, for example, a move sets up an endless cycle.</P>
<P>In presenting the rules, I will begin by explaining namua, the first stage. 
After that I will present the mtaji stage.</P>
<H2>Goal of the Game</H2>
<P>Before starting I would like to repeat the victory conditions of the game. In 
order to win you must either deplete the front row of your opponent or deprive 
him of all legal moves.</P>
<H2><A name=Namua>Namua Stage</A></H2>
<H3>Enter from the Stock</H3>
<P>To start your move you have to look for a hole on your front row that already 
contains one or more seeds. Ignore the empty holes. Now select a hole with seeds 
that has an opposing hole that also contains one or more seeds. Ignore the 
occupied holes with empty opposing holes.</P>
<P>Take a seed from your stock and put it in the hole you have selected. Take 
the seeds in the opposing hole. Now you have captured these seeds.</P>
<P>To repeat, in order to capture seeds from the opponent you must satisfy three 
conditions:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>there must be one or more seeds in your own hole in the front row 
  <LI>there must be one or more seeds in the opposing hole in his front row 
  <LI>you put one seed from your stock into the appropriate hole in your front 
  row </LI></UL>
<P>Diagram 3 shows a situation in which you can capture:</P>

</PRE>
<P>You own the bottom two rows. You can capture by taking a seed from your stock 
and placing it into the hole with seven seeds. Now this hole contains eight 
seeds. Take the seed from the opposing hole. Now you have captured that seed. 
The next section describes what to do with captured seeds.</P>
<H3>You Must Capture If You Can</H3>
<P>It is important to know that you have to capture if there is a possibility to 
do so. Let's return to diagram 3. The capture that the player executed was the 
only possible one. Although he had other holes with seeds, none of them had 
seeds in the opposite holes.</P>
<H3>Entering Captured Seeds</H3>
<P>In diagram 3 you just captured a seed. In Chess or Checkers the opposing 
pieces are removed from play; in Bao the captured pieces (seeds) are brought 
back into play immediately.</P>
<P>Put the captured seed in the extreme left or right hole of your front row. 
These holes are called kichwa (literally 'head').</P>
<P>Let us reconsider diagram 3. If we enter the captured seed in the extreme 
left hole, the situation in diagram 4 arises:</P>
<P><B>diagram 4</B>: entering the captured seed in the left hole</P><PRE>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

</PRE>
<P>The seed is entered in the left kichwa. Because it landed in an empty hole, 
the move ends here.</P>
<P>NB: captured seed(s) are always entered in the first hole, known as the 
<I>kichwa</I>, never in the second or another hole.</P>
<H3>Entering More Than One Seed</H3>
<P>We have seen a situation in which we captured one seed and entered it in our 
front row.</P>
<P>Suppose we capture a hole with more than one seed, what will happen? Take all 
the seeds en sow them in your front row, beginning in the left or right 
kichwa.</P>
<P>Sowing means that one seed is put in the hole that lies next to the hole that 
received the previous seed. Always sow one seed a time and never skip a 
hole.</P>
<P>See diagram 5. Capture the three seeds opposing the hole with seven 
seeds.</P>

<P>If you capture by placing a seed in the hole and taking the opposite seeds, 
then the situation in diagram 6 will occur:</P>

</PRE>
<P>The last seed falls in the third hole from the left. The move then ends, 
because the last seed fell in an empty hole. It is also possible to enter the 
seeds from the right side. In that case, we end up with the siuation in diagram 
8:</P>

</PRE>
<P>The last seed falls in the third hole from the right (which is the sixth from 
the left).</P>
<H3>Kichwa and Kimbi</H3>
<P>Until now I presented situations were you could choose whether to enter the 
seeds from the left or the right. But there are situations in which you can not 
choose. You cannot choose if you capture seeds from the two holes on either end 
of the board. In that case, you must enter the captured seeds on the same side 
where you captured them. These two holes on the extreme left and right have 
special names. The outer ones we already know as kichwa. The second holes from 
left and right we call <I>kimbi</I>.</P>
<P>To make this new rule clearer, see diagram 9:</P>

</PRE>
<P>If you capture by placing the seed from your stock in the hole with one seed, 
you capture four seeds. These four seeds have to be sown from the left; you are 
not allowed to sow them from the right. If you capture the three seeds opposing 
your two, you also must sow them beginning in hole one. If you capture the five 
seeds opposing your three, you must start sowing from hole eight (the kichwa 
from the right). If you capture the six seeds opposing your four, you also must 
enter them starting from the right side.</P>
<P>The result of these capture possibilities I present in diagrams 10, 11, 12 
and 13. For convenience, only the front rows are shown, because there are no 
seeds in the back rows.</P>

<H3>Capturing with Captured Seeds</H3>
<P>Yes, the above title is true: if you capture seeds, they immediately change 
sides and can capture even more opposing seeds!</P>
<P>In diagrams 10 through 13, the last seed ends in an empty hole, ending the 
move. In some situations the last seed to be sown falls in a hole already 
containing seeds. If this happens you can capture the seeds in the opposing 
hole. Of course, this can only happen if there are seeds in the opposing hole. 
If there are none, then take all the seeds from this last hole and sow them 
again, sowing in the same direction.</P>
<P>NB: If you captured a kichwa or kimbi, the direction of sowing can change 
according to the kichwa and kimbi rule presented above.</P>
<P>Remember that you always keep on sowing or capturing. Your turn can only end 
when your last seed falls in an empty hole.</P>
<H3>Multiple Captures</H3>
<P>By capturing with captured seeds, multiple captures are possible. To explain 
this multiple capturing, see diagram 14. Enter a seed in the hole that contains 
two seeds and capture the opposing three.</P>
<P><B>diagram 14</B></P><PRE>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

</PRE>Because it is a kimbi hole, you must start sowing from the left kichwa. 
<P>You capture the three opposing seeds. Because it is a left sided kimbi hole, 
you start sowing on the left side. The last of the three seeds ends in the third 
hole. This hole already contains one seed, so you capture the four seeds of your 
opponent. Take these then and start sowing from the left. You have to start on 
the left, because you were already sowing in that direction. The last of those 
seeds falls in the fourth hole. Because the fourth was empty, the move ends.</P>

<P>Now, go back to diagram 14 and capture the right side kichwa. After 
completing all sowing you will get the postion in diagram 16 as a result.</P>

<H3>To Keep on Sowing</H3>
<P>In some situations the last seed won't fall in an occupied hole having seeds 
in the opposite hole. Take a look at diagram 17.</P>

<P>You capture the seven seeds from your opponent. If you start sowing from the 
left, you will end with your last seed in the seventh hole. It is not empty, so 
your move doesn't end, but there's nothing to capture either. In that case take 
all of the seeds from that hole (there are now six) and start sowing again, not 
changing direction and starting with the very next hole. In this case you will 
end up in the back row, the fourth hole from the left. You can see this result 
in diagram 18.</P>

</PRE>If you capture the seven seeds and start sowing from the right, you will 
eventually end up in the back row, the third hole from the left. 
<H3>To Sow Around the Corner</H3>
<P>In the situations above there were more seeds to sow than there were holes. 
In that case, you keep on sowing in the back row. It is even possible to return 
to the front row, again, if you have enough seeds!</P>
<H3>No Capturing = Takasa</H3>
<P>In some situations, you can not start a move by capturing opposing seeds. 
Take a look at the starting positions (diagram 2) and you will know what I 
mean.</P>
<P>Moves where you cannot start with a capture we call <I>takasa</I>.</P>
<P>If you can't start with a capture, just put a seed in one of your holes with 
one or more seeds, take all seeds and start sowing them. Keep on sowing until 
your last seed encounters an empty hole. During the move, no captures are 
allowed! This is because you didn't start with a capture.</P>Rules of the House, 
Nyumba 
<P>The <I>nyumba</I> (Swahili for 'house') is the hole marked with a rectangle. 
This is always the fifth hole from the left on the front row.</P>
<P>The nyumba ceases to be a nyumba as soon as the seeds it contains are sown. 
After that it is an ordinary hole just as all other holes.</P>
<P>The nyumba has some special rules that add flavor to the game. These rules 
concern, amongst others, keeping on sowing and emptying the nyumba in takasa 
situations. These special rules do not apply if you have fewer than six seeds in 
your nyumba.</P>
<H4>To Stop Sowing</H4>
<P>In the above paragraph 'To Keep on Sowing' I told you that you have to 
continue sowing if your last seed falls in an occupied hole with a hole opposite 
with no seeds. The nyumba is an exception to this rules. If the last seed falls 
in the nyumba and the opposing hole is empty, the player may end his turn if he 
wishes. The opponent then starts his move. See diagram 19.</P>
<P><B>diagram 19</B>: capture the four seeds and start sowing from the right</P><PRE>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

</PRE>
<P>You take the four seeds opposing your nyumba (the nyumba is underlined) and 
start sowing from the right. Now your last seed falls in the nyumba. According 
to the rules, you may either start sowing the seeds or you may stop. If you 
continue sowing, you will end up capturing no other seeds. So, in this case, you 
decide to stop and wait for better chances in later turns.</P>
<H4>Why Stopping?</H4>
<P>As I already said, sometimes it is advantageous to wait for better times. If 
you sow the seeds from your nyumba at the right time, the result can be 
devestating.</P>
<P>For example, take a look at diagram 20.</P>
<P><B>diagram 20</B>: the opponents turn: he must capture the seed</P><PRE>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</PRE>
<P>Your opponent has no choice: he has to capture the seed and put it in his 
right side kichwa, thus ending his turn since it was empty. The result is to be 
seen in diagram 21:</P>
<P><B>diagram 21</B>: end of your opponents turn. Now you must capture</P><PRE>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

</PRE>
<P>Now you capture the seed opposing your two seeds. You enter the seed in you 
left side kichwa. This captured seed is automatically your last seed. The hole 
is not empty and since now there is nothing left to capture, so you take the 
four seeds and start sowing them ending in the nyumba. If you decide to sow the 
seeds fom your nyumba you will capture all other seeds from your opponents front 
row. We call this Bao Hamna: clearance of the front row. You win!</P>
<P>Sowing the seeds from your nyumba at the right time is very tricky to do. It 
is like a climax and is one of the focal points of the Bao game.</P>
<H4>A Takasa Situation with Only Your Nyumba Remaining</H4>
<P>This is the second special rule concerning the nyumba. Take a look at diagram 
22. In this situation you cannot make a capture.</P>

</PRE>
<P>If the nyumba is the only hole left and you can't capture, place a seed in 
your nyumba then take out two seeds and sow them to the left or to the 
right.</P>
<P><B>Always remember that these special rules do not apply if there are less 
than six seeds in your nyumba.</B></P>
<H3><A name=Summary>Summary of the Most Important and Frequently Used 
Rules</A></H3>
<UL>
  <LI>you have to capture if you can 
  <LI>entering captured seeds must be done in the front row from the first hole 
  from the left or right 
  <LI>you have no choice whether to start from the left or right when: 
  <LI>you captured a kichwa or kimbi hole 
  <LI>you have already sown in a direction 
  <LI>if the last seed ends in an occupied hole, capture the opposing seeds 
  <LI>if there is nothing in the opposing hole, take the seeds from you holeand

  <LI>your move ends when your last seed falls in an empty hole. </LI></UL>
<H2><A name=Mtaji>Mtaji Stage</A></H2>
<P>The mtaji stage begins when the namua stage ends. That means that you start 
the mtaji stage when all seeds in the stocks have been brought into play. The 
mtaji stage is not very different from the namua stage.</P>
<H3>Capture</H3>
<P>In the mtaji stage you must capture if you can. Because no more seeds can be 
brought into play, you must take a hole that, after sowing the contents of it, 
ends with the last seed falling in a hole having a hole with seeds opposing it. 
The opposing hole is called mtaji (plural: mitaji).</P>
<P>So we can conclude:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>sow seeds from a hole (that may be a hole from the front or back row) 
  <LI>the last seed from that hole must end in a hole in the front row having 
  one or more seeds 
  <LI>there must be one or more seeds in the opposing hole (mtaji) 
  <LI>the seeds in the mtaji are captured 
  <LI>playing singletons (holes with only one seed in it) is not allowed 
  <LI>if there is no mtaji, you play takasa (which will be explained later) 
</LI></UL>
<P>In diagram 23 you have two possible mitaji. You can play your three seeds to 
the right and capture five, or you can play your nine seeds to the right (sowing 
around the corner) and capture six.</P>

</PRE>
<H3>Takasa</H3>
<P>In the mtaji stage it is not uncommon to have situations in which no captures 
are possible. This can be because there are no occupied holes with occupied 
holes on the opposite side (mtaji), or because there are no holes that when sown 
would end opposite mtaji.</P>
<P>These situations are called takasa. In that case, a player must take a hole 
from the front row and sow it to the left or right. During the move captures are 
not allowed, just as in the namua stage.</P>
<P>If there are no occupied holes in the front row, you may sow a hole from the 
back row.</P>
<P>Take notice: you may never start by sowing a singleton hole.</P>
<P>If there is a hole that is the only mtaji left for your opponent (mtaji 
moja), than this hole may not be sown in a takasa situation. In diagram 24 your 
opponent has a takasa situation. This means that he must sow his five or six 
seeds. Because you have only one mtaji left (the hole with four seeds), he may 
not sow his five seeds. So your opponent must sow his six seeds to the left or 
the right.</P>

<H2><A name=Notation>Notation</A></H2>
<P>In order to facilitate writing down the moves, we designed a notation system 
in cooperation with Bao masters. In this system every hole has a number: one to 
eight for every row. The front row is called 'A' (or 'a' for your opponent), the 
back row is 'B' (or 'b' for your opponent). The difference between the capital 
and small letters is the difference between black and white in Chess. 'L' means 
playing (to the) left, 'R' means playing (to the) right. '&gt;' means that the 
seeds of the nyumba are sown. So 'A5R&gt;' means a seed is put in the fifth hole 
from the left on the front row, capturing opposing seeds and entering those 
seeds sowing them fromt he right. '*' means that there is no capturing (takasa).
